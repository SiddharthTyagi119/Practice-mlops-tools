mlflow ui - to see logs on mlflow server

mlflow--
first file is experiments.py
second file is evaluation.py - like this file you can implement mlflow code evaluation in your ml project

dvc-
first file is test.py for data tracking
to initialize dvc- git init

we never use git for data management/versioning rather we use this for scm . so that's why the main data file not tracked by git.
we never track data by git.
we track the data by dvc mainly .dvc file
under cache folder you will find all the version of the data
in csv.dvc - # key represent the current version of data

commit the changes in git after add data to dvc and its dvc file . add and commit 

remote storage-
dvc remote add -d  remotestorage2 /conifg/workspace/myremotestorage
dvc add data
dvc add .csv.dvc
dvc push

dvc versioning------------
create 2 stages and then - 
dvc repro - for data versioning
dvc lock file and cache file reflects the changes made in files

dvc push- to add data and model at remote to track
after adding the data to remote do git commit like
git add and commit 
git tag v1
git push tag
dvc metrics diff
